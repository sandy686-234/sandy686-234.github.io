Hi, I'm **Huan Zhang**, a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/), working on **Formal Verification** for Autonomous Robotic Systems. My research focuses on Model Checking, Theorem Proving, and Hardware Verification with tools like NuSMV and Synopsys Formality.

I'm currently integrating **Cyclone4A** with ROS to verify robot behaviours and preparing to present my work at CLOCK 2025.
